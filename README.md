# HateSpeechDetectionSystem
This project is designed to detect hate speech—particularly religious(Islam) hate—using comments from YouTube videos. The system processes user-provided URLs, cleans and preprocesses the data, extracts meaningful features, and classifies the content as “Hate” or “Not Hate.”

Key components include:

🌐 Frontend: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interaction.

⚙️ Backend: Developed in Flask (Python) to handle requests, run preprocessing, and make predictions.

🧩 Model: Trained transformer model (XLM-RoBERTa) for hate speech detection.

📊 Visualization: Results displayed with pie charts for better insight.

💾 Dataset: YouTube comments dataset annotated for religious hate.

The system is modular, extendable, and ideal for research or production-level hate speech detection tasks.
